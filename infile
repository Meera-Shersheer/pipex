The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.
To be or not to be, that is the question.
All that glitters is not gold.
Better late than never.
An apple a day keeps the doctor away.
Actions speak louder than words.
A picture is worth a thousand words.
You can lead a horse to water, but you can't make it drink.
The early bird catches the worm.
Rome wasn't built in a day.
Knowledge is power.
Every cloud has a silver lining.
When in Rome, do as the Romans do.
The pen is mightier than the sword.
Time is money.
Beauty is in the eye of the beholder.
A watched pot never boils.
The grass is always greener on the other side.
Laughter is the best medicine.
